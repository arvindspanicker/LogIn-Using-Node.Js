This System uses MongoDb.
So please install mongodb and set the path for log and db.


Then open cmd on this folder,
then execute the following instructions:

npm install
npm start


After that you will recieve a message about the server being run at port 8080

so type
localhost:8080 in the browser.


Thanks.
